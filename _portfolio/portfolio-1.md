For the final project of CSC220: Computer Programming II, we were tasked to write the functionality behind a search engine. I implemented essential data structures such as Queues and Maps from Java's collections. Iterators and sorting algorithms were also employed. The breadth-first search algorithm was employed to help rank the pages. The finished version of the program can take info from a small number of websites that link to each other and rank the websites with the "highest priority", meaning they either contain words that link to other websites or are themselves listed on other websites.
